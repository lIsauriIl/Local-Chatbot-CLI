# Local-Chatbot-CLI
Hi there! I made a chatbot interface that allows you to do some basic customisation of the chatbot before starting the session. These customisations include adding a system prompt, which is basically the same thing as telling your chatbot what it needs to do or help you do, as well as selection of the chatbot model. I made the chatbot CLI using LangChain and Ollama.
